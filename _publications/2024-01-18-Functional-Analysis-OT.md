## Master report (m√©moire, si vous voulez utiliser le terme exact) 

This is the master report I wrote under the supervision of [Ivan Gentil](http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~gentil/),

If you are interested in general summary of application of optimal transport on functional analysis inequalites, you can reach it from [this link](http://afsinoz.github.io/files/Internship_Report__Afsin_Ozdemir_.pdf).
