I am currently a prospective PhD student, who is looking for opportunities. I completed my Master of Science degree at the University Lyon 1, also during my master I did my master's internship under the supervision of Nelly Pustelnik and Antoine Venaille, on non-smooth optimization and its application on oceanographic data. 

I am interested in a wide variety of topics from optimal transport to image reconstruction, where almost every one of them has a common component with a minimization problem.
