I am currently a prospective PhD student, who is looking for opportunities. I completed my Master of Science degree at the University Lyon 1, also during my master I did my master's internship under the supervision of [Nelly Pustelnik](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/nelly.pustelnik/) and [Antoine Venaille](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/antoine.venaille/), on non-smooth optimization and its application on oceanographic data.
